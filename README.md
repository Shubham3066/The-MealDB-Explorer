To run the TheMealDB Explorer application, first ensure that Java JDK 17 or higher, Maven, Git, Eclipse IDE, and a modern web browser are installed on your system. Clone the repository from GitHub and open the backend Spring Boot project in Eclipse using the “Existing Maven Project” option. Once the Maven dependencies are downloaded, run the TheMealDbApplication.java file as a Java application. The backend server will start on http://localhost:5000 and expose REST APIs for categories, meals, search, and random recipes. After the backend is running, open the Frontend folder and launch index.html using Live Server or directly in a browser. The frontend will connect automatically to the backend APIs and allow users to search meals, browse categories, view recipe details, and explore random meals through a responsive and user-friendly interface.
